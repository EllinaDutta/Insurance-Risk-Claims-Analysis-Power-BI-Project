🧾 Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis – Power BI Project

📊 Project Overview
This project explores the insurance domain by analyzing key metrics around policyholders, claim behavior, and risk patterns.

Using Power BI, an interactive dashboard was built to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions related to customer segmentation, claims performance, and risk exposure.
The dataset includes demographic details, vehicle information, and claim history — enabling a holistic understanding of the factors influencing insurance outcomes.

💡 Business Objective

An insurance company wants to better understand its policyholder base and claim trends to improve decision-making.

Currently, data is spread across multiple sources, making it hard to track performance and detect patterns.
To solve this, a centralized Power BI dashboard was developed that provides real-time insights into:
•	Active policy base size
•	Claim frequency and severity
•	Customer demographics
•	Vehicle and regional risk distribution

🧠 Key Insights & KPIs
1.	Total Policies: 37.5K
2.	Total Claim Amount: $187.8M
3.	Claim Frequency: 19.1K
4.	Average Claim Amount: $5K
5.	Gender Distribution: Nearly equal male-to-female ratio
